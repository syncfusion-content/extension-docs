# Xamarin Essential UI Kit

Essential UI Kit for Xamarin.Forms includes predefined XAML templates for Xamarin.Forms apps. The UI kit allows to build a user interface in a cross-platform application. It clearly separates the View, View Model, and Model classes, making it simple to integrate your business logic and make changes to the existing view. 

## Installation of Xamarin UI Kit Extension

Install the appropriate [Xamarin UI Kit Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SyncfusionInc.Essential-UI-Kit-Xamarin-Forms) in Visual Studio by downloading them from the marketplace. As a result, you can use the Syncfusion Extension from your project's Syncfusion menu.

## Include XAML templates in Xamarin.Forms apps

1.	Launch a new or existing Xamarin application.

2.	Select the **Essential UI Kit for Xamarin.Forms** from the **Solution Explorer** by right-clicking on your **Xamarin.Forms** project

	N> The Essential UI Kit for Xamarin.Forms add-in will be shown when the project has the Xamarin.Forms NuGet package as a reference and also, Xamarin.Forms project should be a NET Standard project.

3.	The Category dialogue box will then appear, with its pre-defined template.

5.	If you want to edit your page name, then rename and choose projects which you want to add references.

Navigate to the [help topic](https://help.syncfusion.com/common/essential-studio/licensing/license-key#how-to-generate-syncfusion-license-key), which is shown in the licensing message box to generate and register the Syncfusion license key to your project. Refer to this [blog](https://blog.syncfusion.com/post/Whats-New-in-2018-Volume-2-Licensing-Changes-in-the-1620x-Version-of-Essential-Studio.aspx) post for understanding the licensing changes introduced in Essential Studio. 

## Run the UI template item

To set the desired UI Template item as the start page of your application, Open the **App.xaml.cs** of Xamarin.Forms project and make the following changes.

MainPage=new application name.Views. 

**Item name**.selected template page name();

Example: If you added Login Page,

MainPage=new App1.Views.Login.LoginPage();
