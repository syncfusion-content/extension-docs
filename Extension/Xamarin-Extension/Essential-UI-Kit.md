## Template Selection and naming

The name of the categories such as Login, Chat, E-Commerce page can be changed while adding it to your project. Therefore, the corresponding category will be displayed with the provided name in the View, ViewModel and Model classes of the application.
The main advantage of category dialog window is to choose multiple pages from multiple categories of the UI templates at the time of addition.
