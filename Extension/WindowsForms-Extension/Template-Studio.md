# Syncfusion WinForms Template Studio

The WinForms Template Studio by Syncfusion is a specialized tool for constructing applications with their WinForms components. This studio simplifies development by incorporating crucial Syncfusion components, handling required NuGet references, offering preset namespaces, and creating component render code. Acting as a wizard, it facilitates the creation of WinForms applications using Syncfusion components, streamlining the process for developers.

I> The Syncfusion WinForms Template Studio is available from v24.1.41.

N> WinForms Template Studio is compatible with Visual Studio 2022, Visual Studio 2019, and Visual Studio 2017. For the Visual Studio 2015 or lower versions, it is recommended to use a [WinForms project template](https://help.syncfusion.com/windowsforms/visual-studio-integration/create-project).

Create the Syncfusion WinForms project using the Visual Studio Project Template by following the provided steps.

> Check whether the **WinForms Extensions - Syncfusion** are installed or not in Visual Studio Extension Manager by going to **Extensions -> Manage Extensions -> Installed** for Visual Studio 2019 or later, and for Visual Studio 2017 by going to **Tools -> Extensions and Updates -> Installed**. If this extension is not installed, please install the extension by following the steps from the [download and installation](https://help.syncfusion.com/windowsforms/visual-studio-integration/download-and-installation) help topic.
