# Add a Syncfusion References via Syncfusion Reference Manger

The Add-In launches a pop-up window that contains the list of Syncfusion controls that are loaded, based on the platform of the project. If it is a WPF project, all the Syncfusion WPF controls are loaded.

To add the assemblies:

1. Select the Syncfusion Reference Manager either in the WPF, Windows Forms/Console/Class Library or Silverlight Project.
2. The Syncfusion Reference Manager dialog is displayed as shown in the following screenshot.

5. Reference assemblies
   * Syncfusion assemblies can either be from GAC or from installed location. These options determine the location of the assemblies that are referenced in the project.
   * Syncfusion Essential Studio versions that were previously installed in your machine. This option determines the assembly version that is referenced in the project.
   * Choose the required controls that you want include in project
6. Click Done to add the required assemblies for the selected controls into the project. The   following screenshot shows the list of required assemblies for 
   the selected controls to be added.

8. Then, Syncfusion licensing registration required message box will be shown as follow, if you are installed the trial setup or NuGet packages since Syncfusion introduced the licensing system from 2018 Volume 2 (v16.2.0.41) Essential Studio release. Please navigate to the [help topic](https://help.syncfusion.com/common/essential-studio/licensing/license-key#how-to-generate-syncfusion-license-key) which is shown in the licensing message box to generate and register the Syncfusion license key to your project. Refer to this [blog](https://blog.syncfusion.com/post/Whats-New-in-2018-Volume-2-Licensing-Changes-in-the-1620x-Version-of-Essential-Studio.aspx) post for understanding the licensing changes introduced in Essential Studio.

N> We are providing Syncfusion Reference Manager support for specific framework which is shipped (assemblies) in our Syncfusion Essential Studio setup. So, if we try to add Syncfusion assemblies in project and project framework is not supported with selected Syncfusion version assemblies, the dialog will be appeared along with **“Current build v{version} is not supported this framework v{Framework Version}”** message.
