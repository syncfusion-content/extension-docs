# Overview

It adds the Syncfusion assembly reference to the project, either from the GAC location or from where Essential Studio is installed. It can also migrate the projects that contain the old versions of the Syncfusion assembly reference to newer or specific versions of the Syncfusion assembly reference. Support is provided for this extension, for VS2010, VS2012, and VS2013. This Visual Studio extension is included from Essential Studio 2013 Volume 3 release.

  _Note: This Reference Manager can be applied to a project for Syncfusion assembly versions 10.4.0.71 and later._
