# Add Syncfusion® PDF Viewer SDK component in the Blazor application

The Syncfusion® PDF Viewer SDK code snippet utility for Visual Studio Code includes snippets for inserting a Syncfusion® PDF Viewer SDK component with various features into the Blazor Application's Razor code editor.

   N> The Syncfusion® PDF Viewer SDK code snippet is available from Essential Studio® 2026 Volume 1 (`v*`).

## Add a Syncfusion® PDF Viewer SDK component

The instructions below guide you the process of using the Syncfusion® PDF Viewer SDK code snippet in your Blazor application.

1. In Visual Studio Code, open an existing Blazor Application or create a new Blazor Application.

2. Open the razor file that you need and place the cursor in required place where you want to add Syncfusion® PDF Viewer SDK component.

3. You can find the Syncfusion® PDF Viewer SDK component with the various features by typing the **sf** word in the format shown below.

    ```
    sf<Syncfusion component name>-<Syncfusion component feature>
    For Example, sfpdf
    ```

## Configure Blazor application with Syncfusion

The Syncfusion® Blazor snippet simply inserts the code into the razor file. You must configure the Blazor application with Syncfusion® by installing the Syncfusion® Blazor NuGet package, namespace, themes, and registering the Syncfusion® Blazor Service. To configure, follow the steps below:

1. Open the Blazor application file and manually add the required Syncfusion® Blazor individual NuGet package(s) for the Syncfusion® Blazor components as a package reference. Refer to [this section](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/nuget-packages#benefits-of-using-individual-nuget-packages) to learn about the advantages of the individual NuGet packages. This NuGet package will be automatically restored when building the application.

    N> Starting with Volume 4, 2020 (v18.4.0.30) release, Syncfusion® provides [individual NuGet packages](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/nuget-packages) for our Syncfusion® Blazor components. We highly recommend this new standard for your Blazor production applications.

2. To render the Syncfusion® PDF Viewer SDK components in your application, open the **~/_Imports.razor** file and add the required Syncfusion® Blazor namespace entries.

3. Add the Syncfusion® Blazor [theme](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/appearance/themes) in the `<head>` element of the **~/Components/App.razor** page for Web App and `<head>` element of the **~/Pages/_Host.html** page for server application and **~/wwwroot/index.html** page for a client application.

4. Open the **~/Program.cs** file for Web App and server application and client application then register the Syncfusion® Blazor Service.

    If you select an **Interactive render mode** as `WebAssembly` or `Auto`, you need to register the Syncfusion® Blazor service in both **~/Program.cs** files of your Blazor Web App.

5. If you installed the trial setup or NuGet packages from nuget.org you must register the Syncfusion® license key to your application since Syncfusion® introduced the licensing system from 2018 Volume 2 (v16.2.0.41) Essential Studio® release. Navigate to the [help topic](https://help.syncfusion.com/common/essential-studio/licensing/overview#how-to-generate-syncfusion-license-key) to generate and register the Syncfusion® license key to your application. Refer to this [UG](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/license-key/overview) topic for understanding the licensing details in Essential Studio® for Blazor.
