# ASP.NET Core Scaffolding

Syncfusion provides **Visual Studio Scaffolding** for Syncfusion ASP.NET Core platform to quickly add code that interacts with data models and reduce the amount of time to develop with data operation in your project. Scaffolding provides an easier way to create Views and Controller action methods for Syncfusion ASP.NET Core DataGrid, Charts, Scheduler, Diagram, Tree Grid, Rich Text Editor, Document Editor, and PDF Viewer controls.

N>Check that at least one Entity Framework model exists, and the application has been compiled once. If no Entity Framework model exist in your application, refer to this [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/adding-model?view=aspnetcore-3.1) to generate the Entity Framework model. After the model file has been added, check that the required DBContext and properties have been added. Build the application before try scaffolding. If any changes have been done in the model properties, rebuild the application once before performing scaffolding. 

I> The Syncfusion ASP.NET Core UI Scaffolder is available from v17.4.0.39 for ASP.NET Core MVC application  and provided the Scaffolding support to ASP.NET Core web application from 18.4.0.39.

## Add a scaffolded item

The following steps explain you how to add a scaffolded item to your ASP.NET Core Web application.

> Before use, the Syncfusion ASP.NET Core Scaffolding, check whether the **ASP.NET Core Extensions - Syncfusion** installed or not in Visual Studio Extension Manager by clicking on the Tools -> Extensions and Updates -> Installed for Visual Studio 2017 or lower and for Visual Studio 2019 by clicking on the Extensions -> Manage Extensions -> Installed.
    
 1. Right-click the **Controllers** folder in the Solution Explorer, click **Add**, and then select **New Scaffolded Item…**

 2. In the **Add Scaffold dialog**, select **Syncfusion ASP.NET Core UI Scaffolder**, and then click **‘Add’**.

    ![Choose Syncfusion Scaffolding from Visual Studio Add scaffold dialog](Scaffolding_Images/Scaffolding_Add_Item2.png)

 3. In the Syncfusion UI Scaffolder dialog, select the desired Syncfusion control to perform scaffolding, and then click **Next**.

    ![Choose required control](Scaffolding_Images/Scaffolding_Add_Item3.png)

 4. Syncfusion UI Scaffolder for the selected control dialog will be opened. Enter the **Controller Name** and **View Name** as application requirements, and then select the required **Model Class** of the active project and its relevant **Data Context Class**, and then click **Next**.

    ![Choose required Model](Scaffolding_Images/Scaffolding_Add_Item4.png)

 5. Syncfusion UI Scaffolder for the selected control feature dialog will be opened. Select the required features, update the required data field, and then click **Add**.

    ![Choose required selected control features](Scaffolding_Images/Scaffolding_Add_Item5.png)

 6. The **Controller** and the corresponding **View** files are created into the application  with the selected features of Syncfusion control code snippet.

 7. Then, add navigation to the created view file based on your requirement to open in the webpage.

 8. If you installed the trial setup or NuGet packages from nuget.org you have to register the Syncfusion license key to your project since Syncfusion introduced the licensing system from 2018 Volume 2 (v16.2.0.41) Essential Studio release. Navigate to the [help topic](https://help.syncfusion.com/common/essential-studio/licensing/license-key#how-to-generate-syncfusion-license-key) to generate and register the Syncfusion license key to your project. Refer to this [blog](https://blog.syncfusion.com/post/Whats-New-in-2018-Volume-2-Licensing-Changes-in-the-1620x-Version-of-Essential-Studio.aspx?_ga=2.11237684.1233358434.1587355730-230058891.1567654773) post for understanding the licensing changes introduced in Essential Studio.
 

## Syncfusion ASP.NET Core command-line Scaffolding

Syncfusion provides **Scaffolding command-line** for Syncfusion ASP.NET Core to quickly add code that interacts with data models and reduce the amount of time to develop with data operation in your project. Scaffolding provides an easier way to create view file and Controller action methods for Syncfusion ASP.NET Core DataGrid, Charts, Scheduler, Diagram, Tree Grid, Rich Text Editor, Document Editor, and PDF Viewer controls.

N> Check that at least one Entity Framework model exists. If no Entity Framework model exist in your application, refer to this [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/adding-model?view=aspnetcore-3.1) to generate the Entity Framework model. After the model file has been added, check that the required DBContext and properties are added. Now, build the application, and try scaffolding. If any changes made in the model properties, rebuild the application once before perform scaffolding.

## Install command-line Scaffolding

Install **syncfusion.scaffolding** tool globally by using below command.

**dotnet tool install -g syncfusion.scaffolding** 

## Update command-line Scaffolding

Update **syncfusion.scaffolding** tool globally by using below command 

**dotnet tool update -g syncfusion.scaffolding** 

## Add a scaffolded item from command-line

The following steps explains how to add a scaffolded item from command-line to your ASP.NET Core application.

1. After installed syncfusion.scaffolding tool, we can invoke syncfusion_scaffold command it shows the available controls

	**syncfusion_scaffold**
	
	![CommandLine Scaffold Available Controls](Scaffolding_Images/AvailableControl.png)
	
2. To add a scaffolded item from command-line you have to invoke syncfusion_scaffold application like below syntax	
	
	**syncfusion_scaffold [control][arguments]**

	
	| Parameter                         | Description                                                                   | Control           |

2. If you run the syncfusion_scaffold [control] command, the parameters of control shown like below image.
	
	![control parameter details](Scaffolding_Images/controlparameter.png)
	
3. Run the following command to generate controller and view files through command-line by passing required arguments of the given control.
	
	**syncfusion_scaffold {controlName} --project "{projectFileNamewithPath}" --model {model} -dc {dbContext} -cname {controllerName} -vname {viewName} [controlMantoryParameter] [controlMantatoryParameterValue]**
	
	![CommandLine Scaffold](Scaffolding_Images/commandline.png)
	
4.  As we can see controller and view files generated successfully and also added the Syncfusion NuGet packages and styles which is required to render Syncfusion control.
