## Upgrade project

Syncfusion Project Migration is a Visual Studio Code add-in that allows you to migrate the existing Syncfusion Blazor Web Application from one Essential Studio version to another version.

5. If you installed the trial setup or NuGet packages from nuget.org you have to register the Syncfusion license key to your project since Syncfusion introduced the licensing system from 2018 Volume 2 (v16.2.0.41) Essential Studio release. Navigate to the [help topic](https://help.syncfusion.com/common/essential-studio/licensing/license-key#how-to-generate-syncfusion-license-key) to generate and register the Syncfusion license key to your project.
