## Upgrade project

Syncfusion Blazor migration is a Visual Studio add-in that allows you to migrate the existing Syncfusion Blazor Application from one version of Essential Studio to another. This helps to avoid manual work in the required places when migrating the Syncfusion version.

The following steps will help you **upgrade the Syncfusion version** to the Syncfusion Blazor application via **Visual Studio 2019**:

1. Open the Blazor application that uses the Syncfusion component.

2. To open the Migration Wizard, either of the following options should be followed:

    **Option 1**

    Choose **Extensions-> Syncfusion-> Essential Studio for Blazor ->Migrate Projectâ€¦** from Visual Studio 2019 menu.

5. The Syncfusion Blazor NuGet packages and CDN links are updated to the respective versions in the application.

6. If you installed the trial setup or NuGet packages from nuget.org you have to register the Syncfusion license key to your project since Syncfusion introduced the licensing system from 2018 Volume 2 (v16.2.0.41) Essential Studio release. Navigate to the [help topic](https://help.syncfusion.com/common/essential-studio/licensing/license-key#how-to-generate-syncfusion-license-key) to generate and register the Syncfusion license key to your project.
