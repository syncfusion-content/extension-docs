# Converting Blazor application to Syncfusion Blazor application

Syncfusion Blazor conversion is a Visual Studio add-in that converts an existing Blazor application to the Syncfusion Blazor application by adding the required assemblies and theme files.

The steps below help you to convert the **Blazor application** to the **Syncfusion Blazor application** via the **Visual Studio 2019**:

> Before use the Syncfusion Blazor Project Conversion, check whether the Syncfusion Blazor Template Studio Extension installed or not in Visual Studio Extension Manager by clicking on the Extensions -> Manage Extensions -> Installed. If this extension not installed, please install the extension by follow the steps from the [download and installation](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/visual-studio-integration/visual-studio-extensions/download-and-installation/) help topic.

1. Open your existing Blazor application or create a new Blazor application

2. To open the Syncfusion Project Conversion Wizard, follow either one of the options below:

    **Option 1:**
